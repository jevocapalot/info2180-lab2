      <h2>Why I Chose to Fall in Love with Web Development</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">September 17, 2025 by Jevon Lyons</p>

      <p>Hey world, it's Jevon. <br>
        If you’re reading this, you’ve found your way to my little corner of the internet. 
        I figured my first post should be about the "why." Why code? Why web development? 
        Why spend countless hours staring at a screen, debugging what feels like the same 
        problem for hours on end?</p>
      <p>It starts with a blank screen, a digital void. Then, you type a few lines of cryptic text, 
        hit save, and suddenly: a headline appears. A button takes shape. 
        A vibrant gradient background materializes. You’ve literally created something from nothing. 
        That initial spark of creation is addictive. It’s a feeling I chase every single day.</p>

      <h2>Building My First Interactive Web App: A Rollercoaster of Emotions</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">September 16, 2025 by Jevon Lyons</p>
      <img src="blog22.jpg" alt="Post 2" class="post-img right">
      <p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been buried in work. I understood the concepts, variables, 
        functions, loops in theory. But theory doesn’t build websites. So, I challenged myself: 
        build a simple interactive app from scratch. No tutorials, just documentation, a lot of 
        Googling, and pure grit.</p>
      <p>Spoiler: It was harder than I thought.I’m still a student. I don’t know all the 
        frameworks or best practices (yet!). I’ve had my fair share of moments where a missing 
        semicolon had me questioning my entire life choices. But that’s the beauty of it. 
        Every error message is a puzzle to solve. Every new concept mastered is a level-up in real life.</p>
